- **Key difference**: Explicit relationships between entities
- **Benefit**: Context-rich representation of real-world information

> "Knowledge graphs transform isolated data points into an interconnected network of meaningful information."

## Slide 5: Core Components - Building Blocks
**[VISUAL: Animated diagram showing the three core components]**

### The Three Pillars
1. **Nodes (Entities)** 
   - Represent real-world objects, concepts, events
   - Have types and properties

2. **Edges (Relationships)**
   - Connect entities with meaningful associations
   - Directional with semantic labels

3. **Properties**
   - Attributes on both nodes and edges
   - Provide contextual details
