# Knowledge Graph Tools for Root Cause Analysis

## Tools Evaluation

### Neo4j
- **Description**: Graph database platform with visualization capabilities
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, Cypher query language, visualization tools
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, enterprise features may require licensing

### NetworkX
- **Description**: Python library for graph algorithms
- **Pros**: Simple API, extensive algorithms, Python integration
- **Cons**: Limited visualization options, not designed for large-scale data

### Azure Cognitive Services - Knowledge Mining
- **Description**: Suite of services for extracting insights from data
- **Pros**: Integrates with other Azure services, managed infrastructure
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cost based on usage

### Gephi
- **Description**: Open-source network visualization software
- **Pros**: Interactive visualization, community detection algorithms
- **Cons**: Not designed for programmatic integration

## Integration with Structured Data Analysis

Initial approach will use Python with NetworkX for:
- Data preprocessing
- Graph construction from structured data
- Basic relationship identification

Later migration to Neo4j for:
- Complex pattern recognition
- Interactive visualizations
- Query-based root cause investigation
