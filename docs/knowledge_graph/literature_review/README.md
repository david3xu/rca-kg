# Knowledge Graph Literature Review

## Overview
This literature review provides a comprehensive examination of knowledge graphs, their components, implementations, and applications in root cause analysis. The document is structured hierarchically, with this main file serving as a high-level summary that links to more detailed sections.

## Quick Reference Guide

### 1. [Fundamentals of Knowledge Graphs](fundamentals/README.md)
- **Definition**: A knowledge graph represents a network of real-world entities and illustrates relationships between them through nodes, edges, and labels
- **Key Components**: Nodes (entities), edges (relationships), and labels (attributes)
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Graph theory, semantic networks, ontologies
- **Historical Development**: From semantic networks to Google's Knowledge Graph (2012)

### 2. [Technologies and Implementations](technologies/README.md)
- **Data Models**: RDF triples, property graphs
- **Query Languages**: SPARQL, Cypher, Gremlin
- **Storage Solutions**: Neo4j, AllegroGraph, Amazon Neptune, Azure Cosmos DB
- **Construction Methods**: Manual curation, automated extraction, hybrid approaches

### 3. [Applications in Root Cause Analysis](applications/README.md)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying causal relationships in complex systems
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spotting deviations from expected behavior patterns
- **Failure Mode Analysis**: Linking symptoms to underlying causes
