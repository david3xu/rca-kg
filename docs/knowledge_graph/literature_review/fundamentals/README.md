# Fundamentals of Knowledge Graphs

## Definition and Core Concepts

A knowledge graph represents a network of real-world entities (such as objects, events, situations, or concepts) and illustrates the relationships between them. This information is typically stored in a graph database and visualized as a graph structure, which is the origin of the term "knowledge graph."

### Core Components

1. **Nodes (Entities)**
   - Represent objects, people, places, concepts, categories, or events
   - Can have types and attributes (properties)
   - Example: A node could represent a specific machine, a component, a failure event, or a maintenance procedure

2. **Edges (Relationships)**
   - Connect nodes to each other
   - Directional (have a source and target node)
   - Labeled with relationship types
   - Can have attributes (properties)
   - Example: "Machine_A" -> "CONTAINS" -> "Component_B"

3. **Labels and Properties**
   - Provide additional information about nodes and edges
   - Enable rich semantic descriptions
   - Support querying and filtering
   - Example: A machine node might have properties like manufacturer, model, installation date

## Theoretical Foundations

### Graph Theory

Knowledge graphs are grounded in mathematical graph theory, which provides formal structures for representing relationships between objects:

- **Directed Graphs**: Most knowledge graphs are directed, indicating the nature of relationships
- **Labeled Graphs**: Edges and nodes have labels that denote their types
- **Property Graphs**: Allow attributes on both nodes and edges
- **Multi-relational Graphs**: Support multiple relationship types between the same entities

### Semantic Networks

Knowledge graphs build on the concept of semantic networks from cognitive science and artificial intelligence:

- Represent knowledge in patterns of interconnected concepts and entities
- Use edges to denote semantic relationships (is-a, part-of, causes, etc.)
- Support semantic inference through traversal of connections

### Ontologies

Ontologies provide the semantic framework for knowledge graphs:

- Define vocabularies of entity and relationship types
- Formalize constraints and rules
- Enable reasoning and inference
- Examples include:
  - **Domain Ontologies**: Specific to industries like manufacturing or healthcare
  - **Upper Ontologies**: General concepts applicable across domains
  - **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**: W3C standard for defining ontologies

## Historical Development

### Early Knowledge Representation

- **Semantic Networks (1960s)**: Early AI knowledge representation using nodes and links
- **Frames and Scripts (1970s)**: Structured representation of stereotypical situations
- **Expert Systems (1980s)**: Rule-based systems capturing domain expertise

### The Semantic Web Vision

- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: Subject-predicate-object triples
- **RDFS and OWL**: Schema and ontology languages
- **Linked Data principles**: Connecting structured data across the web

### Modern Knowledge Graphs

- **Google Knowledge Graph (2012)**: Popularized the term "knowledge graph"
- **Industry Knowledge Graphs**: Development of domain-specific enterprise knowledge graphs
- **Open Knowledge Graphs**: DBpedia, Wikidata, YAGO

## Knowledge Graph vs. Similar Concepts

### Knowledge Graphs vs. Knowledge Bases

- Knowledge bases may use various representation formats (not necessarily graphs)
- Knowledge graphs emphasize relationships and network structure
- Knowledge graphs facilitate graph-based querying and traversal

### Knowledge Graphs vs. Databases

- Traditional databases organize data in tables or documents
- Knowledge graphs organize information as a network of relationships
- Knowledge graphs focus on connections rather than just entities

### Knowledge Graphs vs. Ontologies

- Ontologies define formal vocabulary and rules for a domain
- Knowledge graphs instantiate knowledge using ontological structures
- Ontologies can serve as schemas for knowledge graphs

## Key Characteristics of Effective Knowledge Graphs

1. **Expressiveness**: Ability to represent complex relationships
2. **Flexibility**: Adaptability to evolving information needs
3. **Scalability**: Capacity to handle large volumes of data
4. **Coherence**: Logical consistency across representations
5. **Explainability**: Support for transparent reasoning
